It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I\'ve given up on diaper pails in general.

Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.  Forget this pale and go for the Decor.

Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby\'s activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to "remember" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!
